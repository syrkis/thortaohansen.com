o﻿n Lara Demaso's performance: *Her harsh high and deep voice: A polyphony*



As the murmur of conversations begins to die down among the expectant crowd of the Alte Postkasse, a figure in a frilly white dress appears on the other side of a glass partition. Stilled there for a moment. Then, as if struck by pain, she contracts, her body crippling in on itself and emitting a wraithlike whine, thin at first but gathering in power and insistence into a clarion wail.

Exiting now onto the tiled floor she lets loose a series of screeches that extend into breathless guttural growls. The sonic vernacular here is one as close to the plangent sounds of an animal in pain; lowing, bleating, gurgling - as it is to song. Pushing her voice well past her tessitura, past the laryngeal capacity for harmonics, to where it breaks down into a stuttering phonation, she moves with her arms outstretched, writhing - as if animated by a current of sorrow. 

Through the wildly evocative figures of movement and sound I become enmeshed in the historicity of mourning. 

Here emerges the figure of the wailer, I see her in my mind's eye;

*tensive gesturation silhouetted against a roaring funeral pyre,* 

*a voice emanating from the damp darkness of a barrow.*

The wailer allows grief to find its expression by lancing open the oppressive silence with her own pained vocalizing. Through this exteriorization and reification of sorrow, a commodious space for the communal processing of trauma comes into being. 

Wailing (which along with sobbing, crying and weeping, is a universal behavioural response to the affect of grief) is a complicated and somewhat chimeric phenomenon in that it refers to sonic acts anywhere on the scale from the mother shrieking uncontrollably over her infant's corpse, to a professional mourner's highly stylized, acculturated and language elaborated lamentation. Such dichotomization however, becomes further muddled by the fact that our mourning mother, when she expresses her grief within a social funereal context, is also doing so on a stage, the act, natural as it may be, unavoidably becomes inflected with some degree of performativity. Conversely, the professional mourners' performance will likely also require at least some degree of embodiment and internalization of sorrow for her wailing to be read as authentic. Furthermore the fact that the ritual role of the wailer is something that can either be spontaneously donned by a member of the grieving community, or exist as a profession and an identity, makes any attempt at a precise delimitation of the phenomenon highly suspect.  

Enumerating unique permutations across cultures of such sonic practices is outside the scope of this text, but it is worthwhile to mention that wailers/professional mourners are fairly ubiquitous across human cultures, that their last practitioners in Europe are dying out, and that in most cultures they are practiced by women, often middle aged or older, while the eulogization and burial is usually conducted by men.

Lara walks now with the slow poise of a master of ceremonies, entering into the ranks of the seated audience. She halts, the hem of her dress touching a spectator. Standing so close effects an inclusion in the spotlight of the communal gaze, and therefore also to some extent in the ritual space. It creates a dyadic space with the potential to be either intimate or alienating - if you are willing to be intimate with the ritual of pain, it is a gift of intensity and presence that she is giving you. But if you are not able to let yourself be suffused with affective intensity, it becomes merely the drawing up of unwanted attention to your person.

She walks again to the middle of the empty space, here, with arms clutched in front of her abdomen, one slightly higher than the other, she produces a series of truncated moans.  

Lara begins a long circumambulation of the space - a pariah's strut. The staccato of hard leather heels against cold stone floor filling the sonic territory once occupied by sorrowed legato. The wailer marches on because she has to, because it is their officeto be the bearer of the bodily sorrow. This is a burden, an emotional labour (in the herculean sense), that she must shoulder, and she does so alone, under the tall glass nave.

The performance takes place within the large churchlike belly of the Jugendstil Alte Postkasse, a space that feels at once hallowed and inflected with commerce. To me, the movement quality or somatic prosody of grief is an organic one, it is of the structure of boughs and hills and streams, the gridded space, then, becomes a kind of architectural and social stricture within which grief must contort itself to come to expression. The juxtaposition of content and space here precipitates in a critique of our tradition of mourning. It is perhaps exactly because of the erosion of the ceremonial support for grieving in western society that Demaso's performance feels so poignant. 

I also feel like the Alte Postkasse is such a perfect space for this performance, and that certain nuances might have been lost were the piece performed in a blackcube, in nature, or in a sacral space like a church - frontloaded with pathos.

In church sorrow is supposed to find its expression through the singing of psalms, through quiet procession - the bereaved widow might be covered up in cloth, as a way of sequestering and anonymizing grief. Church is a site where the phonation of emotion is supposed to be done in a controlled and structured manner, if one is wailing too loudly one might be led out of the space - a far cry indeed from the tearing out of hair, the smearing of hands with ash, the beating of chests. Such de-intensification of mourning ritual is overwhelmingly evident when the priest is eulogizing in generalizing banalities a person he never knew in life.

Who is allowed to speak? at which times and in which places?

This is a central question in any analysis of power within a society. Since having a voice is essential in the constitution of a political subject, and since the voice is a site of intense gendering, the patriarchal silencing of feminine vocalities becomes a means of effacing the political agency of women.

From notions of *sophrosyne*, to hysteria, to contemporary linguistic coincidency between the word "shrill" and women who participate in politics, the female voice is chronically delegitimized, infantilized, sexualized or otherwise othered. In ancient Greece, rituals containing female vocalization such as the *ololyga* (a ritual scream) were confined to the fringes of the *polis*, so as not to sonically contaminate the civic space inhabited by men. Keening - an ancient cantillatory wailing practice performed by women in Ireland was employed as proof of the barbaric and wild nature of the Irish by british authorities and used as justification for colonial violence. Moroccan wailing traditions are now derided as *al-jahiliya* (belonging to the pre-islamic age of ignorance)  in some communities. Such anxieties surrounding the sonic potentialities of the female voice are a hallmark of patriarchal societies. It is in this context that screaming, wailing, throwing your voice to the very borders of its capacity becomes an act of reclaiming bodily and political autonomy. And to me there is also a certain fearless joy legible there. 

Witnessing the performance I found tears welling in my eyes, I found myself revisiting old sorrow. And I could not help but smile. 

I think many who have lost will have experienced an euphoria; beyond the hot tears dripping on the morgue tiling, the metal ball in the throat, past the ugly grief - there's a respite. It is the feeling of coming to know through sheer affective intensity, through the monumental immensity of sorrow: The plenitude of the self - the deepness of one's inner well. 

Now the speakers in the room begin to play back the sonic emittances from earlier. Lara stands still, then answers - a call and response emerges. Now all at once, echoes of grief, complexly layered, merging multitudinously into a numinous chorality. It is breathtakingly  beautiful, but this crescendo is also striking because it represents a pluralization of the mourning subject. Could it be interpreted as the bereaved community enjoining in cantillation with the professional mourner? As the reintegration of the bereaved subject previously wailing alone? or as the insurmountability of pain echoing in a grief-maddened mind? Either way, Lara manages to both point at inadequacies in secular western ritual infrastructure, and to proffer up an a/effective alternative: To grieve with total abandon.

The performance took place on the 13th and 14th of May in the Angewandte Interdisciplinary lab as part of the Rakete Festival Tanzquartier Wien program, with sound design by Manuel Riegler.
